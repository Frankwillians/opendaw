/**
 * Audio Engine - Web Audio API
 *
 * Per track signal path:
 *   input device ─┐
 *   recorded clip ─┼─> panner -> fxInput -> shaper -> filter -> [signal chain]
 *                  │    -> gain -> mono fold-down -> duck -> master or sub-group
 *
 * Master bus: every track (or sub-group) sums into `masterSum`, passes through
 * a full built-in FX rack (glue EQ / compressor / limiter live there), then the
 * master volume. Two shared send buses (reverb + delay) are fed by a tap on
 * each track and return into the same sum, so the master FX processes them.
 *
 * Sub-groups are a second, smaller version of the master: member tracks land on
 * the group's sum, and the group's fader, pan and mute sit between them and
 * `masterSum`. The duck that a sidechain source applies is computed by an
 * AudioWorklet on the audio thread, so it never depends on a JavaScript timer.
 *
 * Plugin chain supports:
 *   - IR / cabinet convolution (ConvolverNode)
 *   - external AudioWorklet plugins (.js files registering a processor)
 *   - Neural Amp Modeler models (.nam) running through the TONE3000 WASM engine
 *
 * NAM models are wired in parallel and summed back into the chain, so multiple
 * amps play at the same time and can be panned independently.
 *
 * The same chain can be rebuilt inside an OfflineAudioContext to export audio.
